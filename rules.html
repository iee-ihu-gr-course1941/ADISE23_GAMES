                <p>Four cards are dealt to each player and four are placed face-up on the table. Players can pick a card from the ones on the table
                    <i>(the one that suits them best)</i> on the condition that they leave one in its place. The player who gets to choose first is
                    determined clockwise (each time a different player chooses first). After everyone has chosen (a player may choose not to change
                    a card), a 'sweep' occurs, the previous cards on the table are collected, and 4 new cards are dealt face down. The process continues
                    as in the beginning. When a player collects 4 identical cards, they must say the word 'Games' to win.
