                <p> Four cards are dealt to each player and four are placed face-up on the table. 
                    Players can pick a card from the ones on the table (the one that suits them best) on the condition that they leave one in its place. 
                    The player who gets to choose first is determined clockwise (each time a different player chooses first). 
                    After everyone has chosen (a player may choose not to change a card), a 'sweep' occurs, the previous cards on the table are collected, and 4 new cards are dealt face down. 
                    The process continues as in the beginning. When a player collects 4 identical cards, they must say the word 'Games' to win.</p>
