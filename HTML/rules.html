                    <li>Four cards are dealt to each player and four are placed face-up on the table. Players can pick a card from the ones on the table
                    <i><b>(the one that suits them best)</b></i> on the condition that they leave one in its place.</li>
                    <li>The player who gets to choose first is
                    determined clockwise (each time a different player chooses first).</li>
                    <li>After everyone has chosen (a player may choose not to change
                    a card), a 'sweep' occurs, the previous cards on the table are collected, and 4 new cards are dealt face down.</li>
                    <li>The process continues as in the beginning. When a player collects 4 identical cards, he must say the word <b>'Games'</b> to win.</li>
